Biography
Lai entered TVB in 1983 as a clerk in the business department. In 1985, he gave up the job and trained in the TVB Acting School. He starred in many various programs for Educational Television programs, where he was mostly cast as an uncle or eldest cousin in Mathematics, Social Sciences, Health Sciences and Chinese (Cantonese). He also starred in a few series in 1989. He started out in some minor roles, and took on some more significant roles later on. He has left TVB and entered the movie industry. Although those films are low-cost, these years provided a variety of roles and experiences to him. He also acted in two ATV series. He has achieved much praise for his roles, especially in the TVB drama Rosy Business creating a big trend in Hong Kong in 2009.

With much praise from the public, he won Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor in 2008 and 2009 TVB Anniversary Awards respectively. Meanwhile, he won My Favourite Male Character and TVB.com Popular Artist in awarding ceremony and has become the first Best Actor winning 3 awards at the same time. In 2010, he retained the Best Actor award in TVB Anniversary Awards for his role in No Regrets and became the second actor to win consecutive Best Actor award after Gallen Lo in 1997–98. He has since matched Gallen Lo's record of winning 3 Best Actor awards after his win in 2012 for his role in The Confidant.

Lai played different kinds of roles and is liked by a lot of Hong Kong viewers. He is best known for his role in Journey to the West and its sequel, The Gentle Crackdown (co-star with Halina Tam), Off Pedder and Some Day (co-star with Teresa Mo), Rosy Business and No Regrets (co-star with Sheren Tang). Owing to his brilliant performances, he is regarded as a talented TV actor with high popularity.

The TVB Anniversary Awards, officially known as the TV Awards Presentation of TVB, is an annual awards ceremony honoring TVB's programming achievements in Hong Kong television; despite claims that it is the region's equivalent to the American Emmy and the Australian Logie, no other networks are allowed to enter their programmes into TVB competition, and it is awarded solely to TVB programming. Winners are awarded a copy of the golden TVB anniversary statuette, which depicts a man and a woman holding up TVB's square logo. The TVB Anniversary Awards are only one of three TVB awards given out. The other two types of TVB awards that are given out before the anniversary awards are: TVB Star Awards Malaysia and StarHub TVB Awards (Singapore). A list of all TVB awards winners is compiled here in the TVB Awards Winners Lists.

The TVB Anniversary Awards, officially known as the TV Awards Presentation of TVB, is an annual awards ceremony honoring TVB's programming achievements in Hong Kong television; despite claims that it is the region's equivalent to the American Emmy and the Australian Logie, no other networks are allowed to enter their programmes into TVB competition, and it is awarded solely to TVB programming. Winners are awarded a copy of the golden TVB anniversary statuette, which depicts a man and a woman holding up TVB's square logo. The TVB Anniversary Awards are only one of three TVB awards given out. The other two types of TVB awards that are given out before the anniversary awards are: TVB Star Awards Malaysia and StarHub TVB Awards (Singapore). A list of all TVB awards winners is compiled here in the TVB Awards Winners Lists.

Biography
Lai entered TVB in 1983 as a clerk in the business department. In 1985, he gave up the job and trained in the TVB Acting School. He starred in many various programs for Educational Television programs, where he was mostly cast as an uncle or eldest cousin in Mathematics, Social Sciences, Health Sciences and Chinese (Cantonese). He also starred in a few series in 1989. He started out in some minor roles, and took on some more significant roles later on. He has left TVB and entered the movie industry. Although those films are low-cost, these years provided a variety of roles and experiences to him. He also acted in two ATV series. He has achieved much praise for his roles, especially in the TVB drama Rosy Business creating a big trend in Hong Kong in 2009.

With much praise from the public, he won Best Supporting Actor and Best Actor in 2008 and 2009 TVB Anniversary Awards respectively. Meanwhile, he won My Favourite Male Character and TVB.com Popular Artist in awarding ceremony and has become the first Best Actor winning 3 awards at the same time. In 2010, he retained the Best Actor award in TVB Anniversary Awards for his role in No Regrets and became the second actor to win consecutive Best Actor award after Gallen Lo in 1997–98. He has since matched Gallen Lo's record of winning 3 Best Actor awards after his win in 2012 for his role in The Confidant.

Lai played different kinds of roles and is liked by a lot of Hong Kong viewers. He is best known for his role in Journey to the West and its sequel, The Gentle Crackdown (co-star with Halina Tam), Off Pedder and Some Day (co-star with Teresa Mo), Rosy Business and No Regrets (co-star with Sheren Tang). Owing to his brilliant performances, he is regarded as a talented TV actor with high popularity.

He is married and has a son.
